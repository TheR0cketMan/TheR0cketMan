<h2> :construction_worker: About Me:</h2>

Hello 👋 I'm Ryan aka RocketMan.

From a very young age, I began my passion and curiosity with technology, specifically websites, servers and frontend web development. Over the past 16+ years, I have been focusing on and improving my knowledge and expertise in these areas.

In 2014, I started working for several web hosting companies for just over a year, which helped me improve my knowledge and experience.

In early 2021, I founded my own company with the aim of putting customers first. I strongly believe customers should always be a top priority over profit.

I coded the website for my business using Bootstrap 4 & Bootstrap E-commerce (a paid plugin).

I am currently working on a brand new version for my personal website.
