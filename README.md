<h2> :construction_worker: About Me:</h2>

Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ryan aka RocketMan, Founder and Managing Director Roqitt Hosting Ltd.

From a very young age, I began my passion and curiosity with technology, specifically websites, servers and frontend web development. Over the past 16 years, I have been focusing on and improving my knowledge and expertise in these areas.

In 2014, I started working for several web hosting companies for just over a year, which helped me improve my knowledge and experience.

In early 2021, I founded my own company with the aim of putting customers first. I strongly believe customers should always be a top priority over profit.

I coded the website for my business using Bootstrap 4 & Bootstrap E-commerce (a paid plugin).

#### <h3>:building_construction: Currently working on:</h3>

Over the past year, I have been developing my companies new website theme, or as we like to call it, <strong>v3</strong>, following the mockup designed by our business partner <strong><a href="https://partydoosmedia.com/" target="_blank">PartydoosMedia</a></strong>. This version utilises Bootstrap 5. We can't wait to share this with the public over the coming months.
